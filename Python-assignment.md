Imagine you are working as a software developer at VeeSprout company. Your task is to create a Python script that calculates employee salaries based on various parameters such as hourly wage, hours worked, and deductions. You need to handle different types of employees: hourly employees and salaried employees. The final script should generate a report with employee names, total earnings, and net pay after deductions.


Here's a simplified problem statement for this scenario:

Hourly Employees:

For hourly employees, the salary calculation is based on the hourly wage and the number of hours worked. The script should prompt for the following input for each hourly employee:

Employee name
Hourly wage
Number of hours worked
Calculate the total earnings as hourly wage * hours worked.

Salaried Employees:

For salaried employees, the salary calculation is based on the fixed monthly salary and predefined deductions. The script should prompt for the following input for each salaried employee:

Employee name
Monthly salary
Deduct 10% from the monthly salary as taxes and an additional $100 for insurance. Calculate the net pay as monthly salary - (0.10 * monthly salary) - 100.

Generating the Report:

After collecting information for all employees (both hourly and salaried), the script should generate a report that includes each employee's name, total earnings (for hourly employees) or monthly salary (for salaried employees), and net pay (after deductions).
